# dslib

⚙️ A simple, modular C library that provides implementations of basic data structures such as:

- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Deque**
- **Binary Tree**
- **Hash Table**

Implemented generically with `void*` so they can store pointers to any data types. Minimal dependencies, no external libraries—just include headers and compile.

📁 How Data Structures Are Organized

- **Stack** is organised as a singly linked list
- **Queue** is organised as a singly linked list
- **Dequeue** is organised as a doubly linked list
- **Binary Tree** is organised as a binary search tree
- **Hash Table** uses double hashing to handle colissions

🛠️ Functions in the Library
Each data structure lib exposes init, core operations, checkers, cleanup.

You can check **usage examples** for all functions in *main.c* file.
